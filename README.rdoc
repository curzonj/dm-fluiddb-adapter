= dm-fluiddb-adapter

This is a DataMapper adapter for FluidDB (http://www.fluidinfo.com)

It makes heavy use of memcache and uses Typhoeus to parallelize
fetching tag values. TyphoeusClient can also be used independently
to make low-level requests.

== TODO

* Add Set property type
* Add Tag property type
* Add range support for querying date attributes
